2. Gerber files needed for 2-layer & 4-layer PCB boards:
Top layer: pcbname.GTL
Inner Layer 1: pcbname.GL1 (for 4-layer board)
Inner Layer 2: pcbname.GL2 (for 4-layer board)
Bottom layer: pcbname.GBL
Solder Stop Mask top: pcbname.GTS
Solder Stop Mask Bottom: pcbname.GBS
Silk Top: pcbname.GTO
Silk Bottom: pcbname.GBO
NC Drill: pcbname.TXT
Outline layer: pcbname.GKO or pcbname.DO

Note:
 All the gerber files must be in RS-274x format, except the drill file should be in Excellon format. 
 If there is no pcbname.GKO or DO file, please make sure the PCB outline or shape shall at least be specified in other layer, silkscreen or soldermask layer etc. 
 If soldermask layers are not required, please clarify surface finish for both sides when you submit your gerber files.
